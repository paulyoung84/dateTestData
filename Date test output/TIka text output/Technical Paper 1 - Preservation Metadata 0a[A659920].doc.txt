Introduction

This document is the first in a series of technical papers produced by the Digital Preservation Department of The National Archives, covering detailed technical issues related to the preservation and management of electronic records. 

This technical paper describes the preservation metadata scheme developed by TNA for use within its Digital Archive system. Advice and guidance on the use of this scheme by bodies transferring records to TNA can be provided by Digital Preservation Department.

1 Background
The first version of the metadata scheme was developed in 2002, and implemented in April 2003, as part of the operational release of the TNA Digital Archive system. The following existing metadata schemes were consulted as part of this process:


(
OCLC/RLG

(
National Library of Australia
(
National Library of New Zealand
(
VERS
(
CEDARS
· NEDLIB
· English Heritage Centre for Archaeology
· TNA Catalogue (PROCAT)

Elements were drawn from existing schemes, where these were considered to be appropriate, and some additional elements were added to meet the particular requirements of TNA. Many elements are common to most schemes, but in particular cases, the origin of an element is indicated in the detailed descriptions in Section 4.
The scheme was reviewed in December 2003, to take account of nine months operational experience, and to inform the future development of the Digital Archive. The scheme described here represents the result of that review process.

Information model

The preservation metadata scheme uses a simple but powerful information model, which is illustrated below:

A core business requirement was that the scheme should be compatible with the existing TNA catalogue structure, which is based on ISAD(G). Conceptually, the main TNA catalogue provides resource discovery metadata for all TNA records, including objects stored in the Digital Archive. The preservation metadata scheme was developed as an extension to this catalogue structure, providing additional preservation elements specific to digital records. However, for security and operational reasons, some resource discovery elements are also included in the scheme. These map directly to, and are synchronised with, the equivalent elements in the main catalogue.

The top-level information entity in the preservation metadata information model therefore occupies a position mid-way down the main catalogue hierarchy. The higher level entities of department and series are external to the model, although they are referenced through the TNA (PROCAT) reference number for each record.
The accession entity represents a group of records transferred into the archive as a single collection. As such, an accession may either be a new record series, or an accrual to an existing series. The accession entity is used to record the transfer history of the records into the Digital Archive. 
A record represents the conceptual object being stored. Each record may also contain a potentially infinite hierarchy of sub-records. The top-level record always corresponds to a piece within the main catalogue structure. A record may be represented by one or many individual files, which comprise the actual bitstreams stored within the Digital Archive. The scheme separates logical and physical storage structure – each file is stored only once, but may be associated with many logical records.

A record may exist in a number of different technical forms, or manifestations, created to meet requirements for preservation or access. For example, a set of records might originally be accessioned in an obsolete format such as WordStar for DOS. Migration of those records to MS Word format for preservation purposes would create a new manifestation of the same records. A manifestation may comprise one or many files, and files may be shared between multiple manifestations.
The metadata scheme is designed to be extensible, and the information model therefore allows for the definition of additional type-specific entities, with associated element sets. These can be used to provide more detailed descriptions of particular object types, such as images, audio-visual material, or databases. Type-specific elements can extend either record or file entities.
Each entity within this information model is associated with a particular set of metadata elements. These elements are described in the next section. 

2 Metadata Elements

This section describes the individual metadata elements in the scheme. Elements are arranged by entity – for each entity in the information model, an overall metadata map illustrates the arrangements of the various element sub-sets, followed by detailed element descriptions.

Accession

Type-specific extensions

No type-specific element sets have yet been implemented. However, some draft element sets are given for illustrative purposes. Type-specific extensions may apply to either record or file entities. For example, a website or email which is captured as a record may require some specific metadata elements which will apply irrespective of its manifestation in any specific technical environment. Equally, individual files may require additional descriptive metadata at a technical level. 
E1 Record Type-Specific Extensions

Extended metadata sub-sets may be required for type-specific information which applies to the informational content and character of a record. The use of these would be triggered depending on values in the Record Type element (B2.9). The following are provided as examples.

E1.1 Website

Original URL

Original Host
E1.2 Email

Sender Email Address

Recipient Email Address(es)

CC Email Address(es)

BC Email Address(es)

Transmission Date

Subject

Content

Attachments

Note: technical elements such as MIME Version, Content Type and Character Set would form part of a file type-specific extension.
E2 File Type-Specific Extensions

Extended metadata sub-sets may be required for type-specific information which applies to the technical characteristics of a file. The use of these would be triggered depending on values in the File Format ID element (D1.5). The following are provided as examples.

E2.1 Raster Images

Resolution

Dimensions

Bit Depth

Colour Space

Colour Management

Colour Look-Up Table

Compression

E2.2 Audio/Visual

Audio Sampling Frequency

Duration

Audio Bit Rate

Video Bit Depth

Encapsulation
