Procedures for Completing the Survey 
PURPOSE AND DEFINITION

The purpose of this survey is to identify and record the styles and materials of bindings, mainly original but also restored, held by the PRO.

Our aim is to identify and describe both individual items and whole classes or groups of particular styles. At the completion of each class all information will be entered on the database. A concise summary will be written detailing types, styles, dates of documents and any features of interest.

Our intention is not to classify every form of protected document, but only those which in their original or restored state conform to the following definition of a binding.

    ‘Bindings are those documents  which are folded and/or sewn and attached to some form of protective cover and bound in the codex form. These do not include single leaves or bundles of papers, original or restored, attached to a folder by stitching, stapling or treasury tag. If, however, there are items which show evidence of binding structure or materials though not technically bound, these will be included.' 

EXPLANATION OF LEVELS

LEVEL 1

All classes are either ‘inclusive’ or ‘exclusive’. ‘Inclusive’ means that all pieces are taken into account. ‘Exclusive’ means that only those Level 1 pieces that are considered interesting are to be recorded. All others can be ignored. Piece numbers not recorded are then classed as uninteresting as opposed to missing. This will only be the case where there is an excessive amount of non-binding material ( parchment of paper documents, seals, etc...). Very few classes will be ‘exclusive’. This can be determined either by checking the information given on RIS or decided at an early stage in the survey itself.

‘Inclusive’ - details of non-binding pieces can be noted in ‘Comments 1’ if they may be of interest to the class.

The material is often similar and will be quite simple to add to the database using the ‘Duplicate’ button.

Example - ‘Folded Documents’ 

‘Exclusive’ - In these cases there are possibly thousands of pieces or ‘sub-pieces’ so only those of selected interest will be noted.

Examples so far -

Petty Bags

Tally Sticks

Hessian bags

Documents stitched between thick vellum 

LEVEL 2

All bindings will be entered in this Level. Either as ‘Binding’ or ‘Conservation Binding’. The latter will include File Cases and Stitched Folders - a brief description may be made in ‘Comments 2’.

LEVEL 3

These bindings are either those in excellent condition, fine examples of their type or those that have significant features which merit more detailed description. They may have had either minimal or very early restoration.

NOTES ON COMPLETING THE SURVEY

LEVEL 1 FORM

GROUP
Letter Code

· ADM

· E

· WO etc.

CLASS
Number - using 01 or 001 depending on the size of the class.

SUB-CLASS

Not on the form, but on the database. Very uncommon. No-one really knows what it is.

PIECE

As with CLASS, use a two or three digit number depending on the size of the class - 01 or 001.

Some classes (i.e. E101) have a ‘sub-piece’ number. Indicate this as 001/01 etc...

	Part numbers - Indicate as
	01Pt.1
	or (occasionally)
	01A
	

	
	
	01Pt.2
	
	
	01B
	


If there are several documents under the same piece number indicate as -

01a

01b

01c

01d

This is not a recognised PRO piece number so should not be used when ordering. To order a whole box of documents which may or may not have sub-piece numbers, order, for example, E 101 150/BOX.  

DATE TEXT
Use Standard Set. There is a complete set in the offices above which may be borrowed.  Enter directly onto the database using ‘Query’ .

Enter the exact date. Regnal dates can be translated using the calendar kept in the Survey File.

If the date is the reign of a monarch (Tempus) enter the first year of reign followed by ‘t’.

Example ‘Tempus Henry VIII’ - 1509t

If the date is somewhat vague enter the first date of the reign of the monarch followed by ‘c’. i.e. Edward III, enter 1327c.

If it doesn’t make any sense enter ‘?’, or a date followed by ‘?’. This can be checked later. 

No date - n.d. 

The database also has a date-range box. Use this for date ranges. 

A century can be recorded in Date of Text and Date Range e.g. 14thc.:

Date of text       Date range

1300


1400

To save time, do not record dates for non-bindings unless considered  interesting. 

PIECE TYPE

Description of document.

· Binding ( and will always be Level 2 or 3)

· File Case

· Stitched folder

· Box

· Petty Bag

· Tally Stick

· Document

Or any piece which is ‘out’ or ‘missing’. ‘TS’ - To Survey

· TS:Staff

· TS:Conservation 

· TS:Reader

· TS:Missing

Check the date of any ticket, many are years old.

All safe room documents will be surveyed together later -

enter as TS:Safe Room.
DATE
Date of survey. Use formula 01/01/98

The top right hand box can be used to indicate the main category. 

LEVEL 2 

LEVEL 3

Tick if considered suitable for Level 3 and complete the first page of the Level 3 Form instead. 

GROUP, CLASS, PIECE, DATE TEXT and DATE - as Level 1.

DATE BINDING

Contemporary - Use when there is no good reason to suggest that the binding is not contemporary to the text.

Contemporary? - Use when there is good reason to suggest that the binding is at least 50 years later than the text.

Later - Use when it is considered to be the original binding but bound at a much later date than the text, or a rebinding with Rebound in Condition 2.

STYLE

Apart from a few exceptions styles are recorded in types. There is a full list and explanation on page 16. There is also a booklet for each type containing all variations used and a description of each. New styles can be added at any time, using up to six letters and entered in the appropriate booklet.
Sub divisions of STYLE -

MATERIAL 1: Main material


MATERIAL 2: Siding or secondary covering material – any more can be a comment.

COVERING STYLE: e.g. Full; Half, Quarter, Frame, Spine & f.e., or Missing

SECONDARY COVER: Overcover (chemise, envelope, dustjacket – if you want to specify ‘comment’), Overback, Overbands, Overbands & Buckle, Underbands, Undercover (hubs). 

BOARDS : Used to be only at level 3 i.e. Binder’s board, Limp, Wood oak, Wood unknown. 
CONDITION 

TEXT: SEWING: SPINE: COVER/BOARDS:

Excellent - Functions as intended. Has little wear and tear. 

Average - Functions well. Has damage and wear commensurate to its age. 

Poor - Broken or extremely weak and/or damaged. 

REPAIRS

Earlier repairs to the binding.

Restored Minimal - Superficial. Non-structural.

Restored - Rebacked. Structural.

Rebound - Resewn, recovered or completely rebound.

PROBLEMS WITH COMBINATIONS

Contemporary - Average - Restored
Binding fundamentally original, in average condition due to restoration or not, and has been restored.

Contemporary - Average - Rebound. Rebound, but within a few years of the original. Highly unlikely.

Later - Average - Minimally Restored. The first binding, much later than the text, in average condition, with slight restoration.
Later - Average - Restored

The first binding, much later than the text, in average condition, with major restoration work.

Later - Average - Rebound

Not the original binding, in average condition. Possibly not even in the original style, Use Comments 2 to explain.

ANOMALIES

Pch. Ms. of c.1500 bound in full leather c.1850, subsequently rebacked.

Enter - Later - Average - Rebound and note the reback in Comments 2.

SECTIONS

Multi- or Single Section.  

ONE OF MANY

Use to indicate why a volume in excellent condition has not been put in Level 3. As yet unused. Not used since July 2000, but remains on the Table.

ILLUS.

Drawing; Tracing; Photograph

Drawing . These are kept in the Survey File.

Tracing. These are kept in the Survey File.

CROSS REF.

Use to indicate any volume which appears to be related in some way which may not be apparent from the details entered. 

Example - E 101 426/05 & E 101 426/06

COMMENTS

Use keywords if possible. Keywords & phrases used earlier will be listed in the big file & the red card box & on the database.  If an earlier keyword or term is not appropriate the new term should be listed & described in the red card box. It may need cross referencing to a similar term, then added to the keywords list on the database by AC or PR.  In the comment try to use a qualifying word as well e.g. lining, support, board, siding, skin etc. 

All pieces will be called up with Comments but Comments will also be used to extract data about bindings which did not reach Level 3. Use Comments to avoid going on to Level 3. There is a list of Keywords later. Use a semi-colon between entries. 

Comments are subjective & not all instances need to be recorded, they can be a guide to an example & show which class is likely to have more instances. Write comments down in the order a book is bound. 

NO. of COPIES

Use when there is more than one copy of exactly the same binding with the same reference. Not used since July 2000 but remains on the Table.

INPUT

Tick when entered in the database.

COMPLETE 

Tick when all information is entered including the Text Date.

LEVEL 3 FORM

This form is combined with Level 2 as all data on Level 3 pieces will be collected and entered together.

The form consists of  thirteen subject headings -

	1
	COVERING

	2
	BOARDS

	3
	TEXT MATERIAL

	4

	COMMENTS


Headings 1-11 are mainly divided into fields containing a list-box field or tick-box field (except 10.1 BINDING which is a text-box). A list-box field, designated by an open vertical column may only contain one entry. Whereas a tick-box field, which has a series of small closed boxes, can contain as many entries as required.

Headings 12 and 13 are text-boxes. These can be used for free text.

All fields which are relevant to the binding should be completed.

The Style Manual contains further information on the entry headings.
